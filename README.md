📚 Overview

BLOOM is a basic front-end clothing website created using HTML and CSS. Developed as a collaborative academic project, the goal was to implement foundational web development concepts and create a visually appealing, fully navigable multi-page site.

This project helped us gain hands-on experience in structuring a website and styling elements using CSS, along with building page navigation and static UI components.

🌐 Live Pages

The website consists of six interconnected HTML pages:

- Home Page
Features header navigation, footer with social links, and a "Shop Now" button linking to the category page.

- Category Page
Displays three clothing categories (Men, Women, Kids), each linking to a static product listing.

- Product Page
Shows products by category with "Add to Cart" buttons (static due to no JavaScript). Includes descriptions and layout styling.

- Login / Sign Up Page
Contains user login and sign-up forms styled with modern design. Forms include fields like name, email, password, city, and ZIP code.

- Cart Page
Displays added products with quantity, price, total, and buttons to proceed to checkout or continue shopping.

- Payment Page
Simulates a checkout form with input fields for user and payment details. Includes “Place Order” and “Close” buttons.
